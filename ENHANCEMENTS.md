## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Sound effects only work on Windows (winsound)
- No sound volume control yet
- Confetti can be performance-heavy on very old PCs
- Daily challenge feature prepared but not fully implemented
- Dark mode infrastructure ready but not active

### Workarounds
- Linux/Mac: Sounds fail silently (doesn't break app)
- Performance: Confetti only shows for 3 seconds
- Daily challenge: Can be enabled in future update
- Dark mode: Can be toggled in future release
